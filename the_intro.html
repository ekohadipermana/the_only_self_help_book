    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is what I (will) do before working or learning, loading my mind with motivational quotes from 
        great persons, one of them is Dr. Walter Doyle Staples.

    <h2>Introduction from the very first page</h2>
    <h3>How the winner thinks?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A winner is made, not born.</li>
        <li>The main power in your existence is your thoughts.</li>
        <li>You can create your own reality.</li>
        <li>There are certain benefits on every misfortune.</li>
        <li>Every belief you have is a choice.</li>
        <li>You are never defeated until you accept the defeat as the reality and stop trying.</li>
        <li>You have the ability to excel, at least in one aspect in your life.</li>
        <li>The only limitation is the one you impose on yourself.</li>
        <li>No great success without great involvement.</li>
        <li>You need support and cooperation to achieve goals in an organization.</li>
    </ol>
